# DBSQL
Domain Based Structured Query Language
DBSQL is an  intelligent system developed to bridge the communication gap between human language and structured database query languages. It is specifically designed to facilitate seamless interaction between users and relational databases by automatically converting natural language queries into accurate SQL commands. Traditional SQL tools demand significant technical expertise, making them inaccessible to non-technical users or business professionals. DBSQL overcomes this barrier by empowering users to write simple English sentences to fetch data, which the system then translates into domain-relevant SQL queries.
What sets DBSQL apart is its domain-centric architectureâ€”it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, it is trained and fine-tuned on datasets from specific domains such as retail, healthcare, education, finance, and more. This focused approach significantly increases the accuracy and relevance of the generated queries, making it a powerful tool in both academic and enterprise settings.
